# pyenv
#   For a library or package, you might want to ignore these files since the Python version
#   is generally handled by the user. In contrast, for a dedicated application, it's
#   good practice to check them in.

# pipenv
#   According to pypa/pipenv#598, it is recommended to include Pipfile.lock in version control.
#   However, in case of collaboration, if having platform-specific dependencies or dependencies
#   having no cross-platform support, pipenv may install dependencies that don't work, or even
#   fail all together.
#Pipfile.lock

# poetry
#   Similar to Pipfile.lock, it is generally recommended to include poetry.lock in version control.

# pdm
#   Similar to Pipfile.lock, it is generally recommended to include pdm.lock in version control.
#pdm.lock
#   pdm build sets the export-to-binary variable to true by default.
#   To prevent pdm from exporting to binary, set export-to-binary to false in pyproject.toml
#   or use the --no-binary flag with the build command.
